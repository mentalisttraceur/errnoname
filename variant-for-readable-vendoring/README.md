This folder contains a variant of `errnoname.c` which contains
exactly the same C code as the one in the parent folder, but
the autogenerated code has been pulled out into `.c.inc` files
in order to make it easier to see the actual substance of the
`.c` file.

This variant is for you if you want to copy `errnoname` into
your project but you find the `errnoname.c` in the parent
folder off-putting because the reams of autogenerated code
make it harder to look at and understand what's going in
that file.
